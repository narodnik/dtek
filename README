Developed on Manjaro Linux

=========================
Ubuntu 18.10 instructions
=========================

As root navigate to home dir:

  $ sudo su
  # cd

Then download and run the install script:

  # wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/narodnik/dtek/master/ubuntu-install.sh
  # chmod +x ubuntu-install.sh
  # ./ubuntu-install.sh

This will build the wallet in the root dir.

Change permissions and move it into user home directory (replace myuser with
your username):

  # chown myuser:myuser -R dtek/
  # mv dtek ~myuser

Now press CTRL-D to exit from root:

  <CTRL-D>
  $

Now create 3 terminals. We will represent them by 1$, 2$ and 3$.

  1$ - terminal for the server
  2$ - for the wallet of user 'harry'
  3$ - for the wallet of user 'dave'

First start the server:

  1$ cd dtek/
  1$ ./darktech --server

Next we will create a wallet for harry and give him 10 BTC. We represent
the amount on the commandline using satoshis (10 * 10^8):

  2$ cd dtek/
  2$ ./darktech -u harry -w harry.db -a 1000000000

Now start harry's wallet. He should have a balance of 10 BTC:

  2$ ./darktech -u harry -w harry.db

Now start dave's wallet. He should have a balance of 0 BTC:

  3$ ./darktech -u dave -w dave.db

In harry's wallet, enter dave as the destination and the amount you wish
to send, then click send.

Vice versa for dave sending to harry.

Lastly to reset the demo, delete these files:

  $ rm -fr blockchain/ harry.db dave.db
